# Data-Modification-Example-Drug-Utilization

Preparing 5 quarters of statewide HIV drug-utilization data for PHI-free demo

This SAS program was written to prepare a proof-of-concept demonstration of Sisense BI tool for the Arizona Department of Health Services. 

The original data is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Privacy Act (HIPPA) and contains protected health information (PHI). I wrote the program to create ficticious dates and strip other identifying information/PHI. The data was then deliverable to the vendor for a POC demo to bring an enterprise-wide analytics tool to an organization with no master patient index.
